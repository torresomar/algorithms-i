The problem with QuickFind is that Union is way expensive.

If we would like to make a N union on N objects it would be N².
N² algorithms for large problems are not acceptable.
They do not scale!!!

###### Quick-Union

It is a lazy approach
- Integer arra id[] of size N
- Interpretation : id[i] is parent of i
- Root of i is id[id[id....[id[i]....]]]

The problem with quick union is that trees can reach a very tall height.
Find may be very expensive.

###### Quick-Union Improvements

Weighted quick-union
- Avoid tall trees
- Keep track of the size of each tree
- Balance by linking root of smaller tree to root of large one

Data Structure : Same as QU but with and extra array sz[i] to count the numebr of objects in the tree rooted at i.

Find: Identical

Union: Modify QU to
- Link root of smaller tree to larger tree
- Update the sz[] array

```java
int i = root(p);
int j = root(q);
if(i == j) return;
if(sz[i] > sz[j]){
  id[j] = i;
  sz[i] += sz[j];
}else{
  id[i] = j;
  sz[j] += sz[i];
}
```
Running Time:

- Find: takes time proportional to depth of p and q
- Union: takes constant time, given roots.

Proposition:

Depth of any node x is at most *lg N*
